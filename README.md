This repository is some algorithm pratice. including some Algorithm coursework in NYCU.
And also have some CPE practice like leetcode style problems. These code are all using C++ programming

Lab 1:
Implemented a sweep line algorithm with set-based pruning to solve the 2D closest pair problem in **O(nlogn)** time.

Lab 2:
Built an optimal binary search tree**(OBST)** using dynamic programming**(DP)** with Knuth’s optimization to reduce time complexity to **O(n²)**.

CPE-Code:
Some practice.
