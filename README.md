## üìÇ Contents

- **Lab 1:**  
  Implemented a sweep line algorithm with set-based pruning to solve the 2D closest pair problem in **O(n log n)** time.

- **Lab 2:**  
  Built an **Optimal Binary Search Tree (OBST)** using dynamic programming (DP) with **Knuth‚Äôs optimization**, reducing the time complexity to **O(n¬≤)**.

- **CPE-Code:**  
  Contains 16 C++ solutions for various algorithm and data structure problems.
